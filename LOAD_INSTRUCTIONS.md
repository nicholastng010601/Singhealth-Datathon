# Loading and Using Our Model

Our model's code has been arranged in sequence for easy execution. To obtain the model and make predictions, follow these steps:

## Step 1: Obtain the Repository

Either clone our repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nicholastng010601/Singhealth-datathon.git
```

or download the python notebook from our submission file on Devpost.

## Step 2: Install the required dependencies.

Go to our requirements.txt file, type pip install ___ , where the empty space is the entire contents of the txt file copied and pasted.

## Step 3: Run the Model Training

Open our repository and run all the cells to train the model.

## Step 4: Predict the hidden datasets using our model

Scroll down to the last cell, and run the testing_hidden_data function with the hidden dataset.

## Note

The commented out code is our working to show the thought process taken to reach our final code. It is not needed to be ran.
